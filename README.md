# sprint4pjkt
Project for sprint 4 in the triple ten DS course
https://sprint4pjkt.onrender.com/

This is a small project to display the quantity of cars for sale differentiated by classics and new (new being no older than 25 years) and the days they've been on the lot also filtered by new vs classic.
